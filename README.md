You can find the API that I used to get all the Pokemon data on this page: https://pokeapi.co/

This is a project, heavily modeled on the official Pokemon website, specifically the PokeDex tab: https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/

You can search for any of the 898 pokemon from different pokemon series, use the name of the pokemon or its ID number.
In addition to the above, you will have access to the picture of each pokemon and to information about it,
such as the type of pokemon, height, weight and all the statistics found in pokemon games.
You can use the general sort or by specific types or colors of pokemon that interest you.
